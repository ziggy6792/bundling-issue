## Getting Started for developers

Make sure you have node, npm and docker installed (you can run `node -v`, `npm -v` and `docker -v` to check)
`yarn install`
`yarn start` Will start mongo db dev container and api in dev mode (uses `ts-node-dev` to restart on every change)
`yarn esbuild` bundles with esbuild
`yarn build` build with tsc
`yarn start:build` start build code
